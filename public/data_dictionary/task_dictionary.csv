bird_alligator,executive_function,"Bird-alligator is an inhibitory control measure in which children are asked to follow the directions delivered by a bird puppet (go trials) and not follow the directions delivered by an alligator puppet (no-go trials). For the youngest children, there are twelve test trials. Older children have the same initial twelve test trials followed by another twelve trials with a rule switch (do what the alligator says). All children are given enough practice go and no-go trials to correctly respond to each type of command multiple times, indicating they understand the rules. Coded behaviors for each trial (go and no-go)are as follows: No movement: child does not move in response to puppet’s command. Wrong movement: child performs a movement that was not commanded by the puppet. Partial movement: child starts to perform the commanded movement and then stops and does not finish the movement. Full movement: child fully performs the commanded movement. Each trial is also coded based on whether the child’s response was delayed by at least two seconds. Trials are not codeable if the child is not actively playing, if the experimenter shows the child how to do an action and the child repeats it (imitation), or if the child is physically restrained from performing actions or is physically helped to perform the action",,
grass_snow,executive_function,"Grass/snow is an inhibitory control measure. A game mat is placed in front of the child: it has a green square in one corner, a white square in the other corner, and mittens in the center, meant for the child to place their hands in between trials. After asking the child what colors grass and snow are, the experimenter instructs the child to point to the green square after she says ‘snow’ and point to the white square after she says ‘grass.’ After the child successfully completes one practice trial for each condition, the experimenter delivers 14 codeable trials.
 
 Each trial is coded for correctness, based on the child’s response.
 
 1: correct response.
 0: incorrect response.
 The trial is uncodeable if the coder cannot see the child and/or the mat, or if the child isn’t participating in the game.",,
gift_delay,executive_function,"Gift delay is a regulation to reward measure in which the experimenter presents a gift bag to the child, but then leaves the room to look for a bow for the gift, asking the child to wait to open the gift until she returns: no touching, and no peeking. The gift bag placed on the table in front of the child. The task starts when the door closes as the experimenter leaves the room, and continues for 3 minutes or until the child pulls the gift out of the bag. Coding for this task was completed using the video annotation program ELAN.
 
 Gift delay is coded along tiers which are not mutually exclusive - any amount of behaviors can be coded simultaneously, with the exception of ‘no view.’ Coded behaviors are as follows:
 
 On seat: the child is considered ‘on seat’ as long as any part of their body is touching their chair (but not if they are solely touching the chair by playing with their name tag on the back of their chair).
 Eyes on: the child is looking at the gift (or at the tissue paper that they have pulled out of the bag and are handling).
 Touching: any part of the child’s body is intentionally in contact with the bag. (If the child pokes or taps the gift for 10 seconds with spaces of less than half a second between touches, one 10-second annotation is made for touching.)
 Opening bag/peeking in: the child is gazing into the interior of the bag or pulling the bag open with the intention of seeing the gift.
 Putting hand in the bag: the child puts their hand(s) in the bag or touches/handles the tissue paper inside of the bag, but not the gift.
 Pulling gift from bag: coded when the gift is made visible to the coder as a result of the child’s actions.
 No view: coded when the child is not visible to the coder. No other behaviors can be coded while ‘no view’ is being coded.",,
fruit_stroop,executive_function,"Fruit stroop is an inhibitory control measure in which the experimenter shows the child both small and large cartoon pictures of three fruits. The child is then asked to identify pictures of the small fruits within pictures of the larger ones. Then the child is asked to identify pictures of the large fruits (while ignoring the small fruits inside of them) for a total of 6 codeable trials.

The potential behavioral codes for each trial are as follows:

2: child points to the correct picture.
1: child points to the wrong picture but then correctly changes response during the same turn.
0: child points to the wrong picture with no self-correction.
Uncodeable: the trial wasn’t presented, or the child doesn’t participate; talking to the experimenter or attending to other things.",,
snack_delay,executive_function,"Snack delay is a regulation to reward measure in which the child is asked to wait to eat a piece of candy until the experimenter rings a bell, which is demonstrated by the experimenter. The child is told to keep their hands on a mat while waiting. There are four trials of 10s, 20s, 30s, and 15s wait times, in that order. The experimenter lifts the bell half-way through each trial, and rings the bell at the end of each trial.

There are two parts per trial: Part 1 - time from start of trial until experimenter lifts the bell, and Part 2 - time from experimenter lifting the bell until experimenter rings the bell. The child’s behaviors are coded during each of the two parts of each trial.

Coded behaviors include: child eats snack, child touches snack, child touches cup and/or bell, child waits until bell is lifted, child waits until bell is rung, and child keeps hands on mat. The child receives bonus points if they kept their hands on the mat throughout entire parts of trials or entire trials.",,
sustained_attention,executive_function,"Sustained attention is an attentional control measure that lasts for 5 minutes during a free play task, starting after the child is told to play with the toys. The child enters the room to a table full of toys. The child is instructed to stay at the table and play with the toys in front of them while the experimenter works on something in the same room. The experimenter reads through some papers on the couch in front of the child while ignoring the child completely. Coding for this task was completed using the video annotation program ELAN. All behaviors were only coded if they occurred for at least 0.5 seconds.

Sustained attention is coded along tiers which are not mutually exclusive, with the exception of ‘no view.’ Coded behaviors are as follows (defined by Ruff & Capozzoli, 1995):

Eyes on (casual attention): the child is looking at the toys, but not fully engaging with them. Breaks in ‘eyes on’ must be at least 0.5 seconds to be coded.
Settled attention: a pause in the child’s causal attention to look at and physically manipulate a particular toy or a set of toys within a singular play episode. ‘Settled’ is when the child is both looking at and touching the same toy, or bringing new toys in to the same play episode.
Focused attention: concentrated attention that involves ‘an intent facial expression, minimal extraneous bodily activity, a posture that encloses the object of interest and brings it closer to eyes, and either no talking or soft talking (relevant to the toys the child is playing with).’ ‘Focused attention’ refers to a state in which attention is directed more or less exclusively to one target or task and not divided or shared between targets or tasks. The assumptions are that, during focused visual attention, selectivity becomes narrower and restricted to fewer elements. The degree of effort or energy directed at the target tasks is increased.
No view: the purpose of ‘no view’ is to account for portions of the video during which the child may be doing a code-able behavior (e.g., looking at the toys) but we cannot tell because of the camera angle.",,
door_opening,executive_function,"Door opening is a regulation to reward measure in which a toy square and triangle are used to give candy (reward) or take away candy (punishment) each time they ‘visit’ after knocking on a small door. First, a research assistant models how to play the game, and wins some candy. After each door knock, the child is asked if they ‘want to keep playing or stop playing.’ The trials proceed with 4 consecutive rewards, 1 punishment, 3 consecutive rewards, 2 consecutive punishments, etc., so that if the child plays all trials they are only left with one piece of candy before the experimenter ends the game.

Each trial is only coded if the child chooses to play.

An ‘intentional delay’ is coded if the child intentionally pauses for at least 2 seconds before deciding to open the door. If the child is attending to something else or talking to the experimenter etc., this does not count.

A ‘forced trial’ is coded if the experimenter opens the door against the child’s decision to not open it, or the child’s silence or lack of response. If the child chooses to stop playing within the first 3 trials, the experimenter will force them to play. Starting with the 4th trial, the experimenter will stop playing if the child says they want to stop.

The total number of forced trials, total number of doors opened (not forced trials), total number of delays after a reward, and total number of delays after a punishment are recorded.",,
