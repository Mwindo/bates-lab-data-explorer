bird_alligator,executive_function,"Bird-alligator is an inhibitory control measure in which children are asked to follow the directions delivered by a bird puppet (go trials) and not follow the directions delivered by an alligator puppet (no-go trials). For the youngest children, there are twelve test trials. Older children have the same initial twelve test trials followed by another twelve trials with a rule switch (do what the alligator says). All children are given enough practice go and no-go trials to correctly respond to each type of command multiple times, indicating they understand the rules. Coded behaviors for each trial (go and no-go)are as follows: No movement: child does not move in response to puppet’s command. Wrong movement: child performs a movement that was not commanded by the puppet. Partial movement: child starts to perform the commanded movement and then stops and does not finish the movement. Full movement: child fully performs the commanded movement. Each trial is also coded based on whether the child’s response was delayed by at least two seconds. Trials are not codeable if the child is not actively playing, if the experimenter shows the child how to do an action and the child repeats it (imitation), or if the child is physically restrained from performing actions or is physically helped to perform the action"
grass_snow,executive_function,"Grass/snow is an inhibitory control measure. A game mat is placed in front of the child: it has a green square in one corner, a white square in the other corner, and mittens in the center, meant for the child to place their hands in between trials. After asking the child what colors grass and snow are, the experimenter instructs the child to point to the green square after she says “snow,” and point to the white square after she says “grass.” After the child successfully completes one practice trial for each condition, the experimenter delivers 14 codeable trials.
 
 Each trial is coded for correctness, based on the child’s response.
 
 1: correct response.
 0: incorrect response.
 The trial is uncodeable if the coder cannot see the child and/or the mat, or if the child isn’t participating in the game."
gift_delay,executive_function,"Gift delay is a regulation to reward measure in which the experimenter presents a gift bag to the child, but then leaves the room to look for a bow for the gift, asking the child to wait to open the gift until she returns: no touching, and no peeking. The gift bag placed on the table in front of the child. The task starts when the door closes as the experimenter leaves the room, and continues for 3 minutes or until the child pulls the gift out of the bag. Coding for this task was completed using the video annotation program ELAN.
 
 Gift delay is coded along tiers which are not mutually exclusive - any amount of behaviors can be coded simultaneously, with the exception of “no view.” Coded behaviors are as follows:
 
 On seat: the child is considered “on seat” as long as any part of their body is touching their chair (but not if they are solely touching the chair by playing with their name tag on the back of their chair).
 Eyes on: the child is looking at the gift (or at the tissue paper that they have pulled out of the bag and are handling).
 Touching: any part of the child’s body is intentionally in contact with the bag. (If the child pokes or taps the gift for 10 seconds with spaces of less than half a second between touches, one 10-second annotation is made for touching.)
 Opening bag/peeking in: the child is gazing into the interior of the bag or pulling the bag open with the intention of seeing the gift.
 Putting hand in the bag: the child puts their hand(s) in the bag or touches/handles the tissue paper inside of the bag, but not the gift.
 Pulling gift from bag: coded when the gift is made visible to the coder as a result of the child’s actions.
 No view: coded when the child is not visible to the coder. No other behaviors can be coded while “no view” is being coded."
